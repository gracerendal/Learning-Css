        <h1>To my Boyfriend</h1>
        <p>keeping our love growing may be tough<br>
        the road to pleasing each other may be rough<br>
        but we'll see each other through <br>
        Such that none of us will ever rue</p>
        
        
        <p>Yet you may find this difficult to believe <br>
        Your pains you may feel I'm hoping to relieve;<br> 
        you think I'm just trying to deceive<br> 
        Alas! It is love I perceive!</p>
        
        <p>Moments of affectionate love may be few <br>
        And figthing may seem  due;<br>
        Coping with each other may not be in view<br>
        But  our love will forever be new</p>
        
        <p>True love, they say, is full of trial<br>
        Especially when it will more than fill a phial<br>
        Still the number to your heart I try to dial<br>
        And that is beacause I STILL LOVE YOU!</p>
